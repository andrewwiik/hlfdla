                            <p class="lead"> The Highland Lakes Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary will be holding their Annual Tricky Tray on August 10, 2018 at the Highland Lakes Fire House located on Canistear Road in Highland Lakes, NJ. <br><br> We are soliciting donations for our Tricky Tray and would greatly appreciate a donation from you. All donations would be recognized as donated by your company during the drawing. We would love to add your companyâ€™s name to the list of organizations that help make our event a success.<br><br>Donations can be mailed to the post office box above or sent to HLFDLA C/o Donna Wiik, 79 Hickory Road, Highland Lakes, NJ 07422. Or, if it is more convenient, you can call Donna at 973-886-9995 or email us at <a href="mailto:HLFDLA@gmail.com">HLFDLA@gmail.com</a> and she will arrange for your donation to be picked up. <br><br> Highland Lakes is a small community and our Fire Department is entirely volunteer. While Vernon Township does provide some funding it does not assist with many of the expenses to run and maintain the physical building or numerous other expenses necessary to operate the department so that the firefighters are able to effectively respond when the unfortunate need arises. These expenses are paid for through donations and fundraisers, like our annual Tricky Tray, held throughout the year. <br><br> The Highland Lakes Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary is a 501(c)3 organization. The non-profit status of the Highland Lakes Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary can be verified at <a href="http://apps.irs.gov/app/pub78">http://apps.irs.gov/app/pub78</a> .<br><br> A copy of our 501 (c) 3 certificate can be faxed or emailed upon request.Please keep this letter for your records. A receipt will be sent if requested and a retail value is given. </p>
